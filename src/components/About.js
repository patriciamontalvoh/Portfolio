      <p>From a very young age, I have always had a great interest in technological issues, from the mechanisms that make up a complex device to the base materials they are made of and the technologies behind them. I am curious by nature and seek to understand how things are made, how they work, how they are perceived, and how they can be further improved to have a greater impact on society and the environment. On a different dimension, I have always had a great passion for art, design, and creativity.{} </p>

      <p>While in high school, I realized I wanted to pursue an undergraduate degree in industrial design, as it would allow me to realize something far beyond art, technical features, or functionality, through their skillful combination. I pursued my undergraduate degree in Industrial Design Engineering, specializing in product development, at Elisava in Barcelona, arguably the most prestigious school in its field in Spain. {} </p>
      <p>During and after my studies, I have had the opportunity to explore design from different perspectives, including product design, service design and advanced manufacturing.
This has allowed me to grow beyond my academic training, learning how to tackle design challenges in a wider and more interdisciplinary way. Not only focusing on design aspects but also considering other factors such as human-centered perspectives, emerging technologies, environmental and social responsibility, and profitability. Furthermore, I have come to deeply appreciate the undeniable importance of emerging technologies, as well as the need for digitalization, innovation, and entrepreneurship in today’s society.{} </p>
<p>This broader perspective nurtured a desire to deepen my studies and explore my capabilities in a more ambitious approach. Which led me to pursue a master’s degree in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship at Brown University, where I am currently reinforcing my education in the fields of technology, business strategy, entrepreneurship, and UX/UI, with a keen focus on digital transformation.{} </p>
<p><strong>With this background, I now aspire to become a professional UX/UI designer specializing in digital transformation and interface enhancement. My goal is to integrate my diverse experiences into the realm of digital transformation, innovation, and design, in order to create meaningful, intuitive, and inclusive digital experiences.
